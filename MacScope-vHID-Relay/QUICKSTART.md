# Quick Start Guide - MacScope VirtualHID Installer Fix

## What Was Wrong

Your installer was failing with **"Bootstrap failed: 5: Input/output error"** because:
- The `macscope-vhid` binary tried to access Karabiner's virtual devices immediately
- But Karabiner-DriverKit-VirtualHIDDevice wasn't fully ready yet
- This caused the binary to crash instantly, triggering the I/O error

## What's Fixed

✅ **LaunchDaemon plist** now waits up to 30 seconds for Karabiner to be ready  
✅ **Installer script** verifies Karabiner is ready before proceeding  
✅ **No Python3 dependency** - uses native bash tools  
✅ **Better error messages** with clear troubleshooting steps  
✅ **Comprehensive logging** to `/var/log/macscope-vhid.log`

## Test It Now

### 1. Quick Test (Without Installing)

```bash
cd /Users/meklows/Documents/GitHub/MacScope/MacScope-vHID-Relay
chmod +x test_installation.sh
sudo ./test_installation.sh
```

This will check:
- ✅ Is Karabiner installed and approved?
- ✅ Is the daemon running?
- ✅ Are files in the right place?
- ✅ Is everything working?

### 2. Install/Reinstall

```bash
cd /Users/meklows/Documents/GitHub/MacScope/MacScope-vHID-Relay
chmod +x install_vhid_relay.sh
sudo ./install_vhid_relay.sh
```

**What happens:**
1. Checks you're running as root ✓
2. **NEW:** Waits for Karabiner to be ready (up to 30s)
3. Downloads latest files from GitHub
4. Installs binary + plist
5. Starts daemon with readiness checks
6. Verifies everything worked

**Expected output:**
```
[ok] Karabiner VirtualHID ready after 3 attempts
[ok] Installed macscope-vhid binary
[ok] Installed LaunchDaemon plist
[ok] Daemon bootstrapped
[ok] Daemon is registered in launchctl
[ok] Daemon is running and listening
=== Installation Successful ===
```

### 3. Monitor Logs (In Another Terminal)

```bash
# Watch daemon startup
sudo tail -f /var/log/macscope-vhid.log

# Expected output:
# [startup] Waiting for Karabiner VirtualHID driver...
# [ok] Karabiner VirtualHID ready after 3 attempts
# [launch] Starting macscope-vhid relay
# VirtualHID relay listening on /tmp/macs_vhid_501.sock
```

### 4. Verify It's Working

```bash
# Check daemon status
sudo launchctl print system/com.macscope.vhid.relay | grep state
# Should show: state = running

# Check socket exists
ls -l /tmp/macs_vhid_*.sock
# Should show: srwxrw-rw- (unix socket)

# Test from MacScope app
# Open MacScope → VirtualHID Manager → Test keyboard/mouse
```

## If It Still Fails

### Problem: "Karabiner VirtualHID driver/daemon not ready"

**Fix:**
1. Install Karabiner-DriverKit-VirtualHIDDevice:
   - Download: https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-DriverKit-VirtualHIDDevice/releases
   - Run: `sudo installer -pkg Karabiner-*.pkg -target /`

2. Approve the system extension:
   - Open System Settings → Privacy & Security
   - Click "Allow" next to Karabiner-DriverKit-VirtualHIDDevice
   - **Restart macOS** if prompted

3. Verify it's ready:
   ```bash
   systemextensionsctl list | grep Karabiner
   # Should show: activated enabled
   
   pgrep -x "Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice-Daemon"
   # Should return a PID number
   ```

### Problem: "ERROR: Virtual keyboard device not found"

This means the daemon started too early. **This is now fixed!** The new plist waits 30 seconds.

But if you still see it:
```bash
# Check if Karabiner devices exist
ls /dev/Karabiner*
# Should list keyboard and pointing devices

# If missing, restart Karabiner daemon
sudo pkill -9 Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice-Daemon
# It will auto-restart via launchd
```

### Problem: Daemon won't start

```bash
# Get detailed error
sudo launchctl print system/com.macscope.vhid.relay

# Check bootstrap errors
sudo launchctl bootstrap system /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.macscope.vhid.relay.plist

# View full logs
sudo tail -50 /var/log/macscope-vhid.log
sudo tail -50 /var/log/macscope-vhid-install.log
```

## Commit to GitHub

Once tested and working:

```bash
cd /Users/meklows/Documents/GitHub/MacScope
git add MacScope-vHID-Relay/
git status  # Review changes
git commit -m "Fix: Add Karabiner readiness checks to prevent I/O error 5

- Added 30-second wait loop in LaunchDaemon plist
- Added pre-flight checks to installer script
- Removed Python3 dependency for better compatibility
- Enhanced logging and error messages
- Created test script and documentation"
git push origin main
```

## Update MacScope App

The installer in your app bundle is already updated:
```
/MacroUI.app/Contents/Resources/install_vhid_relay.sh ✅
```

**If you need to rebuild the app:**
1. Copy the fixed script to your Xcode project resources
2. Clean build folder
3. Rebuild and test

## Need Help?

Check logs in order:
1. `/var/log/macscope-vhid-install.log` - installer output
2. `/var/log/macscope-vhid.log` - daemon runtime
3. Console.app → search "macscope" - system messages
4. Console.app → search "Karabiner" - driver messages
